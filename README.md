# OpenMM Examples

This is a number of examples of [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) molecular dynamics simulations.
It is meant mainly as a personal reminder but comments or suggestions are of course greatly appreciated.
Most of the examples are in Juputer Notebook format (`*.ipynb`) that can previewed directly from Github.

Description of the examples:

- [`continuum_na`](continuum_nacl/nacl.ipynb). Aqueous 1:1 electrolyte solution using a continuum solvent together
  with Ewald summation. The simulated cation-anion PMF is compared with Debye-HÃ¼ckel theory.
