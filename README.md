# OpenMM Examples

This is a number of examples of [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) molecular dynamics simulations.
It is meant mainly as a personal reminder but comments or suggestions are of course greatly appreciated.
Most of the examples are in Juputer Notebook format (`*.ipynb`) that can previewed directly from Github.
